# light_spectrum_classification
 The workflow contains three parts.  
 Firstly, PCA method is implemented to reduce the dimension of the high light spectrum image.  
 Secondly, feature extraction method is implemented to extract the feature of the image. Here, I use GLCM, LBP and Gabor.  
 Thirdly, classifier is implemented to achieve classification. Here, I use KNN method and SVM.
